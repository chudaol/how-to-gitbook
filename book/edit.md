# How to edit your book locally

Just open it in your favourite editor/IDE and write some markdown!

Now comes the very interesting part. I will show you how easily, quickly and painlessly test your changes in real time.
It's just one command. gitbook serve. CD to your book directory and run gitbook serve:

    gitbook serve
    
Open your browser on address  http://localhost:4000
Congratulations! You are looking at your book!

Now even more interesting part. When you edit your book, it is automatically reloaded in the browser:

Write your book, add your images, do whatever you want locally. Don't suffer of the slowness of the online editor!
